        Classic lasagna recipe
    </h2>
    <p>
        This classic lasagna recipe has an easy meat sauce as the base, layered with noodles and cheese.<br>
        This is great for feeding a big family, and will freeze well.<br>
        The key for this recipe is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than other recipes.
